# About

Cobalt was created to support the [Design Tokens Format Module (DTFM)](https://designtokens.org) and provide a pluggable, extensible interface for generating code for any platform.

## Project Goals

1. Support the complete and full [Design Tokens Format Module](https://design-tokens.github.io/community-group/format) spec.
1. Offer the widest compatiblity possible for any platform.
1. Support a pluggable and configurable architecture, enabling users to write their own plugins to generate any format.

## Why the name “Cobalt?”

The name **Cobalt** has three meanings:

1. Cobalt [the element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt) is a nod to design tokens being the “atoms” of your design system.<br />
   _Fun fact: the animated token icons on this docs site are a nod to Cobalt’s hexagonal atomic structure_
2. Cobalt [the pigment](https://artsartistsartwork.com/history-of-the-colour-blue-in-art) is a nod to blue being the last missing color in art history, just as design tokens are the last missing piece of design systems.<br />
   _Fun fact: Van Gogh once said “Cobalt is a divine colour and there is nothing so beautiful for putting atmosphere around things”_
3. Cobalt the color is a nod to [blueprints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueprint).<br />
   _Fun fact: blueprints originally were colored with Prussian Blue (ferrous ferrocyanide), not Cobalt, for cost reasons_
