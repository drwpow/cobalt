# Terrazzo Token Tools (Beta)

Terrazzo is a work-in-progress, but comprises:

- ✅ CLI for working with the [<abbr title="Design Tokens Community Group">DTCG</abbr>](https://designtokens.org) specification (formerly known as “Cobalt UI”)
- ✅ Components for documenting / working with tokens
- ✅ (Coming Soon) Token Lab for generating & managing design systems

## CLI

Generate any code (CSS, JS/TS, Sass, JSON, Tailwind, etc.) using a <abbr title="Design Tokens Community Group">DTCG</abbr> format `tokens.json` file. Previously known as Cobalt. [See docs](/docs/cli).

## Components

React components for building and managing design systems:

- [React Color Picker](/docs/components/color-picker): pick colors using the latest formats like OKLCH, in pixel-perfect color reproduction using WebGL.
- [Tiles DS](/docs/components/tiles): A suite of React components to showcase your design system docs.
