## Usage

A `number` token theoretically has many creative uses. But in practice. It canâ€™t be used for a [font weight](/tokens/font-weight), and has no units like a [dimension](/tokens/dimension) requires.

However, it can be used for `lineHeight` within a [typography token](/tokens/typography) (as a shorthand for [em](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units#relative_length_units) dimension), as well as stops within a [gradient token](/tokens/gradient).
