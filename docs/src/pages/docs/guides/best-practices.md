# Best practices

Best practices are only community conventions meant to fill in opinions when you have none. Disregard any information in here if it doesnâ€™t work with your organization, or if there is a conflict between this information and your configuration.

## Casing

Prefer **camelCased** properties when possible:

```diff
  {
    "typography": {
-     "base-heading": {
+     "baseHeading": {
        "$type": "fontFamily",
        "$value": "sans-serif"
      }
    }
  }
```

This will result in more predictable naming, and in many languages is simpler to reference (for example, in JavaScript):

```diff
- tokens.typography['base-heading'].$value;
+ tokens.typography.baseHeading.$value;
```
