# About

Cobalt was created to support the [Design Tokens Community Group format (DTCG)](https://designtokens.org) and provide a pluggable, extensible interface for generating code for any platform.

## Project Goals

1. Support the complete and full [Design Tokens Community Group format](https://design-tokens.github.io/community-group/format) spec.
1. Offer the widest compatiblity possible for any platform.
1. Support a pluggable and configurable architecture, enabling users to write their own plugins to generate any format.

## Why the name “Cobalt?”

Cobalt is the only element in the Periodic Table that is also a color. Design tokens are the “building blocks” of design much like elements are the building blocks of nature.
